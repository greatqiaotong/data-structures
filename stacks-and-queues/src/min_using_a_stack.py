"""
Implement the MinStack class which will have a min() function. Whenever min()
is called, the minimum value of the stack is returned in O(1) time. The element
is not popped from the stack. Its value is simply returned.

- Input: min() operates on an object of MinStack and doesnâ€™t take any input
- Output: Returns minimum number in O(1) time
